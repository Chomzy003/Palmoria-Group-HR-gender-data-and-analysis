Power BI analysis of Palmoria Group‚Äôs HR data to uncover gender distribution, pay gaps, bonus allocations, and salary compliance. Includes data model and dashboard.
# Palmoria Group HR Gender & Pay Gap Analysis

## Overview

This project was developed as part of an HR analytics case study for Palmoria Group, a Nigerian manufacturing company. The company faced public scrutiny over gender inequality and pay disparities, which threatened its reputation and growth ambitions.

The goal of this analysis was to investigate gender-related issues in the workforce, salary structure compliance, and bonus allocation, and provide actionable insights to management.

This project also represents a milestone in my portfolio-building journey and showcases my skills in Power BI data modeling, cleaning, DAX, and dashboard design.

## Dataset

Two HR datasets were provided:
- **Palmoria Employee Data:** containing employee demographics, salary, region, department, and performance ratings.
- **Bonus Mapping Data:** defining rules for bonus allocation based on department and rating.

These datasets were imported into Power BI, cleaned, modeled, and visualized.

## Data Cleaning & Preparation

Steps performed:
- Used the first row as column headers
- Renamed columns for clarity (e.g., `Location` ‚Üí `Region`)
- Removed rows where `Department` was `NULL`
- Removed employees with no salary (they had exited the company)
- Assigned `"Undisclosed"` to employees with missing gender information
- Changed column data types to appropriate formats (e.g., salary as numeric)
- Created calculated and conditional columns:
  - `Dept Rating` ‚Üí to map department and rating to bonus table
  - `Annual Bonus` ‚Üí salary √ó bonus rate
  - `Total Pay` ‚Üí salary + annual bonus
  - `Salary Band` ‚Üí grouped salaries into $10,000 bands (e.g., $10,000‚Äì$20,000, >$120,000)

## Business Questions Answered

- What is the gender distribution across the company, by region and by department?
- How do employee ratings vary by gender?
- Is there evidence of a gender pay gap? If so, in which departments and regions?
- Does Palmoria comply with the minimum salary regulation of $90,000?
- How are employees distributed across salary bands company-wide and by region?
- What is the total annual bonus allocation by employee, by region, and company-wide?
- What is the total pay (salary + bonus) by employee, by region, and company-wide?

## Dashboard

An interactive Power BI dashboard was created that includes:
- Gender distribution visuals (company-wide, by region, by department)
- Ratings by gender
- Salary structure and pay gap visuals
- Salary band distributions
- Compliance KPIs (e.g., minimum salary compliance rate)
- Bonus allocation summaries
- Slicers for filtering by Region and Department

## Key Insights

- Gender imbalance observed in certain departments and regions
- Evidence of gender pay disparities in specific regions and departments
- Many employees fall below the $90,000 minimum salary requirement, especially in some regions
- Bonus allocation favors higher-rated employees, with slight gender skew
- Most salaries cluster between $70,000 and $90,000

## DAX & Power Query Code Samples

### Assigning Undisclosed Gender
```powerquery
= Table.ReplaceValue(#"Change Type","","Undisclosed",Replacer.ReplaceValue,{"Gender"})
```

### Creating Dept Rating (Power Query Custom Column)
```powerquery
= Table.AddColumn(#"Unpivoted Columns", "Dept Rating", each [Department]&"/"&[Attribute])
```

### Calculating Annual Bonus (DAX)
```DAX
= Table.AddColumn(#"Replaced Value", "Annual Bonus", each [Salary]*[Bonus Rate])
```

### Calculating Total Pay (DAX)
```DAX
= Table.AddColumn(#"Added Custom", "Total Pay", each [Salary]+[Annual Bonus])
```

### Salary Band (Power Query Conditional Column)

| Condition           | Output            |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| Salary <= 20000     | `$10,000‚Äì$20,000` |
| Salary <= 30000     | `$20,000‚Äì$30,000` |
| ‚Ä¶                   | ‚Ä¶                 |
| Salary > 120000     | `>$120,000`       |

## Tools & Techniques

- Power BI Desktop
- Power Query for data cleaning and transformation
- Data modeling (relationships between Employee and Bonus Mapping tables)
